# How to Write Clean Code

Writing clean code is an essential skill for any developer. It not only makes your code more readable and maintainable but also makes it easier for others (and future you) to understand and modify. Here are some key principles to follow.

## Understandable and Consistent Naming

Good naming is crucial for readability.

- **Variables**: Choose names that clearly describe their purpose.
- **Functions**: Name them based on what they do. If a function retrieves a user, name it `getUser`.

> "Choosing good names takes time but saves more than it takes." - _Robert C. Martin_

## Keep Functions Small and Focused

A function should do one thing and do it well.

1. Limit the length of functions. Aim for 10-20 lines.
2. Avoid side effects. A function should not modify any hidden states.

## Comment Wisely

Comments should explain _why_, not _what_. Code should speak for itself.

- Use comments for clarification of complex code.
- Avoid redundant comments.

## Refactoring

Regularly refactor your code to make it cleaner.

- Remove duplicate code.
- Simplify complex logic.
- Break large functions into smaller ones.

## Consistent Formatting

Consistency is key.

- Stick to one coding style.
- Use linters and formatters like ESLint or Prettier.

## Avoid Deep Nesting

Deep nesting makes code harder to read and maintain.

```javascript
// Bad
if (condition) {
  if (anotherCondition) {
    // ...
  }
}

// Good
if (condition && anotherCondition) {
  // ...
}
```

## Error Handling

Don't ignore errors. Handle them gracefully.

- Use try-catch for error-prone code.
- Validate inputs to prevent errors.

## Stay DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

Avoid repetition. Use functions, classes, and modules.

## Readable Code over Clever Code

Readable code is always better than clever, tricky code.

> "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand." - _Martin Fowler_

## Continuous Learning

Stay updated with best practices and constantly improve your skills.

Writing clean code is a practice that develops over time with experience and constant learning. Always be open to new ideas and improvements!
