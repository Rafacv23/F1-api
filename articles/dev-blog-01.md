# 🚀 What´s coming up for F1 Connect API?

The 2024 Formula One season it´s over and the team behind of F1 Connect are working hard to bring you new features and better performance for the next season.

## 🔝 Priorities

The TOP priorities at this moment are:

- **Performance**: We want to increase the performance and speed of the different endpoints.
- **Design**: We are bringing a new redefined ui, more intuitive and easy to understand for you.

## 🆕 Changes

Changes that are already deployed:

1. **New UI**: New colors, new header with searchbar, new documentation page, focused on the speed.
2. **Blog**: As you can see if you are reading these, F1 Connect have a new blog section to post dev updates and F1 news.

```alert
❗ We are open to publish articles from the community in the blog.
```

## 📌 Next

With the new ui and the blog deployed, our next objectives are:

- **Refactor**: The api endpoints, with new cache system, implementing an orm (Drizzle).
- **Testing**: We are retesting all the endpoints with Playwright to achieve a better user experience.
- **Data management**: We are updating our systems to retrieve data from the races, to bring you the latests results as soon as posible.

## Contributting

We are always open to get PRs, translations, issues, articles and suggestions from the community in [Github](https://github.com/Rafacv23/F1-api).

F1 Connect it´s a free and open source project, so we aprecciate a lot any Github star or sharing our work with the community.
