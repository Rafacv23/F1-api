# 🚀 New Docs page!

Happy new year 2025! 🎉

We are happy to announce that we have a new docs page, with a new design and a new structure. We think this is a great improvement to the current docs, and we hope you like it too. 😊

## ⚠️ Advice

With these new changes, we are changed a few enpoints responses, so we recommend you to update your code to the new structure. If you need any help, please open an issue in our [Github](https://github.com/Rafacv23/F1-api).

## 📌 Next

Our next objectives are:

- **Testing**: We are retesting all the endpoints with Playwright to achieve a better user experience.
- **Caching**: The api endpoints, with new cache system, implementing redis
- **Data management**: We are updating our systems to retrieve data from the races, to bring you the latests results as soon as posible.
